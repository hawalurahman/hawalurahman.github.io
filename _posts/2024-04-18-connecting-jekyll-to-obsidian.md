title: Connecting Jekyll to Obsidian
---

This post is created using Obsidian.

My workaround is following:
1. clone my github repository to my local computer
2. pull everything
3. open the `_posts` folder inside Jekyll as an Obsidian Vault
4. write the thing that you want
5. save
6. push

It turns out to be quite easy - I don't have to pull out `wsl2` for this anymore. It is simpler but does it work?

Well,

it does.
