title: Declutter

When the workload seems to be hard and burdening, the first thing I do is investigate whether I have a cluttered desk or not. Having been decluttering for a long time, it became intuitive to clean my desk. Along the cleaning process, I find it relaxing and help me calm down. Removing junks and reorganize cables feels like removing the cloud inside my head. Often I found resolution and ideas on what to do next while I clean my desk. I know nothing about psychology or behavioral science, but decluttering helps me alot.

> Uncluttered desk leads to uncluttered mind.

Since 2019, I have been a fan of minimalism and decluttering, especially for work desk. The idea is to have only what we really need during the work. For me, my laptop, a keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor is enough to have in my desk. I rarely used pen or pencil but I do have like a cup holder for them in my desk too. The key is to have only what I need.

I took this idea to my college dormitory up until now. Wherever I have a work desk, the only things you will see are mentioned above, with some exceptions if I have limited surface appliances. But the idea is the same. 

Once in a while, usually in about 2-3 weeks, I like to evaluate how my desk looks and feel. If it began to feel cramped or crowded with useless stuff, I sort them up and re-organize it to make it work again. Let's call this activity as decluttering. 

> My simple approach to decluttering is to **throw away things that are not useful** anymore and **keep the other in the drawer**. 

Usually I threw away things such as plastic from things or packages that I unwrap on my desk or other small things like a pen cap or empty pen or broken stuff. For the stuff that I keep in my drawer, usually consist of books I have (or haven't - and not really urgent) read, notebooks, papers (which mostly filled with sketches and idea dumps), office supplies, phone chargers, and electronics (earphone, watch, external hard drives, flash disk, etc).

Consequently, since I had to throw things into my drawer too, I had to evaluate what is in there that I may want to dispose. Old batteries for example. 

Once I have sorted everything and the remaining things on my desk are what I actually need, I will clean the surface. Wet tissue often do the tricks. I then wipe it again with paper towel to help it dry faster. I like to see a shiny desk (and actually feel it too).

There is also special approach if I have monitor or many electronic devices that I have to keep around. 

So, if usually I declutter once every 2-3 weeks, I have a more strict rules regarding to electronics especially cables. I hate cables laying around on my desk. I have switched my mouse and keyboard to the wireless ones to avoid the mess of having cables laying around. However for audio devices I still have some compromises as the wireless audio device often lacks clear microphone so I stick with wired ones.  So basically, I hate cables.

For electronics and cables, once every 3-5 days I will begin to feel uncomfortable and organize them in a way that does not hamper my productivity and easy on the eye. One simple trick I use is to have a tiny gap between my desk and the wall, and throw every cable there to hide the mess. This is especially helpful for stationary devices such as laptop. I kept the charger brick (since I have a gaming laptop) on the desk but throw the cables down the gap so they become less visible. As for phone or other devices chargers, I bought a cable tie with velcro to help reorganize them. I roll them up and tie them, then throw them into my drawer. When I need to charge, I can easily retrieve the roll from the drawer. This approach has helped me in keeping my desk simple and uncluttered. 

> Declutter has been an important part of my productivity routine

I like to have a clean desk. It helps me to focus on things that are actually important. It removes distraction and unnecessary interactions. 

Declutter your desk and feel the difference.

Cheers,
