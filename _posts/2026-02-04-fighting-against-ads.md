I don't like ads. I tried my best to remove any ads on my device or apps that I used. Here are some of my journey on removing these ads. 

## What makes ads annoying to me

Here are several things that makes me annoyed to ads:
1. Weird and unrelated content to my interest. e.g. gambling/online loans/shopping thing.
2. Spamming my notification, making important ones unnoticed because it was just a mess - plus constant nudge on my smartwatch too
3. Not enjoyable to watch some long content
4. Prone to missclick

## YouTube

I enjoy watching contents on YouTube and we all know how they always put a lot of ads. There is no way to fight this ads besides subscribing to a YouTube Premium subscription, which I did. Any other solutions you found out there might have some sketchy scenario behind it. Remember Honey apps trap? Yup, that sort of thing. Its not like I havent tried some of the alternatives, but really subscribing to a YouTube Premium is the easiest one. However, I only advice you to do so if you spent > 4 hours a day on this site, or you listen to YouTube Music. I don't have cable TV on my apartment so YouTube is practically my source of entertainment on screen. 

## SMS

Yes, I received a lot of promotional messages in my SMS. I partly blamed my provider for this issue. I think they just enrolled you to an advertisement service so you definitely will receive dozens of SMS everyday. What is really annoying from this is that the important messages will quickly scrambled with these ads making them unnoticed. My solution for this is quite complicated: I setup a Shortcut to automatically unregister the related ads to my provider. Fortunately my provider still allows me to unregister so I did exactly that. 

## Notification Wall (from Apps)

So I received tons of notifications that are unimportant, like "Hey checkout or promo on 10/10!" or "Hey, this item is on flash sale!" or "Hey you are eligible for our 50000 million credits". These are very annoying!

Some apps will allow you to turn off the promotional notification. But some of them just dont put this option. So I did the ultimate way to shut them up: I just revoke their permission to send me notification from system level. 

So you go to settings, notifications, find the annoying apps, and just disable every notification. 

Most of the time they are apps that you rarely use anyway. So I dont miss out on much. Plus if its very important apps, like banking or e-money, they provide email to you so you can be more attentive. 

## Email

Honestly this is probably quite simple. Google now has a filter for subscribed items. Or you can just click on each promotion and click unsubscribe. I think 20 minutes can clear almost every ads I had. You can probably do it too. 

## Reflection on the ads content

I have tried my best to turn off ads preference. So I get the most general ads within a certain region, I believe. There is one ads that really annoyed me and make me think: online loans. Or say it as pinjol. 

I saw these types of ads everywhere but only on a specific country. If you change the country/region settings on YouTube, you will get completely different experience. 

So this makes me think, what does this ads have to do with this country? does it reflect a certain condition or trend within the country?

And finally, how bad is the country if online loans is being promoted massively towards the audience? why would you allow this to happen (both regulators and creators)?

Probably its better to just wonder and keep everything by myself. Its just sad to me that this is what I have to watch. Also its even more sad to think when people actually followed what these ads are offering. Can you imagine how hard would it be for them?

## Ideally

No one should receive unrelated ads. Only show one on the market. Don't spam it everywhere. Only advertise beneficial and truthful products.
