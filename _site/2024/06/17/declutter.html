    <p>When the workload seems to be hard and burdening, the first thing I do is investigate whether I have a cluttered desk or not. Having been decluttering for a long time, it became intuitive to clean my desk. Along the cleaning process, I find it relaxing and help me calm down. Removing junks and reorganize cables feels like removing the cloud inside my head. Often I found resolution and ideas on what to do next while I clean my desk. I know nothing about psychology or behavioral science, but decluttering helps me alot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Uncluttered desk leads to uncluttered mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since 2019, I have been a fan of minimalism and decluttering, especially for work desk. The idea is to have only what we really need during the work. For me, my laptop, a keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor is enough to have in my desk. I rarely used pen or pencil but I do have like a cup holder for them in my desk too. The key is to have only what I need.</p>

<p>I took this idea to my college dormitory up until now. Wherever I have a work desk, the only things you will see are mentioned above, with some exceptions if I have limited surface appliances. But the idea is the same.</p>

<p>Once in a while, usually in about 2-3 weeks, I like to evaluate how my desk looks and feel. If it began to feel cramped or crowded with useless stuff, I sort them up and re-organize it to make it work again. Let’s call this activity as decluttering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My simple approach to decluttering is to <strong>throw away things that are not useful</strong> anymore and <strong>keep the other in the drawer</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually I threw away things such as plastic from things or packages that I unwrap on my desk or other small things like a pen cap or empty pen or broken stuff. For the stuff that I keep in my drawer, usually consist of books I have (or haven’t - and not really urgent) read, notebooks, papers (which mostly filled with sketches and idea dumps), office supplies, phone chargers, and electronics (earphone, watch, external hard drives, flash disk, etc).</p>

<p>Consequently, since I had to throw things into my drawer too, I had to evaluate what is in there that I may want to dispose. Old batteries for example.</p>

<p>Once I have sorted everything and the remaining things on my desk are what I actually need, I will clean the surface. Wet tissue often do the tricks. I then wipe it again with paper towel to help it dry faster. I like to see a shiny desk (and actually feel it too).</p>

<p>There is also special approach if I have monitor or many electronic devices that I have to keep around.</p>

<p>So, if usually I declutter once every 2-3 weeks, I have a more strict rules regarding to electronics especially cables. I hate cables laying around on my desk. I have switched my mouse and keyboard to the wireless ones to avoid the mess of having cables laying around. However for audio devices I still have some compromises as the wireless audio device often lacks clear microphone so I stick with wired ones.  So basically, I hate cables.</p>

<p>For electronics and cables, once every 3-5 days I will begin to feel uncomfortable and organize them in a way that does not hamper my productivity and easy on the eye. One simple trick I use is to have a tiny gap between my desk and the wall, and throw every cable there to hide the mess. This is especially helpful for stationary devices such as laptop. I kept the charger brick (since I have a gaming laptop) on the desk but throw the cables down the gap so they become less visible. As for phone or other devices chargers, I bought a cable tie with velcro to help reorganize them. I roll them up and tie them, then throw them into my drawer. When I need to charge, I can easily retrieve the roll from the drawer. This approach has helped me in keeping my desk simple and uncluttered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Declutter has been an important part of my productivity routine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to have a clean desk. It helps me to focus on things that are actually important. It removes distraction and unnecessary interactions.</p>

<p>Declutter your desk and feel the difference.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Halim</p>
