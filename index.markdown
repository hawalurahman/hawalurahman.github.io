# Welcome

## Hi, my name is Halim

I am a computer science student. I do little research and write for fun. I am fascinated by natural language processing although I consider myself as a beginner in the field. I am currently studying Language Models (LM) and trying to make something useful out of it. Have any ideas? 

## This website

I want to have a space where I can write things and share my updates and publications. I want to reach you and provide convenient when reading my content. No ads are allowed on this site. I just want simplicity. What matters the most is the story.

Navigate through the mess:
